# Phillipowder

Phillipowder is a web-based visual interface designed to support narrated military battle simulations.
It provides a shared spatial and informational framework where a narrator constructs and controls a scenario, and players act as commanders within it. The project name references the Battles of Philippi (42 BC), where uncertainty, miscommunication, and command decisions shaped outcomes as much as force.

Phillipowder does not simulate combat outcomes.
It exists to organize terrain, units, visibility, and communication so that decisions and results can be narrated, adjudicated, and interpreted by humans, providing an integrated and functional framework for command and control interpretation.

Phillipowder is under active development.
Features, structure, and implementation details may evolve as the project matures.
